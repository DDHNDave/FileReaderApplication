# Specification 

Antura programming test
This test takes already existing code and asks you to improve it. After the code has been submitted,
we would like to go through it together with you and discuss your solution. There is no time limit,
and you may use online resources for help, as long as you write the code yourself.
The task
Specification
Write a console program that takes one argument, a path to a file.
Open that file and count how many times its filename (minus the file extension) occurs in the file&#39;s
contents.
Example: If the argument is &quot;myfile.txt&quot; it should count how many times the string &quot;myfile&quot; occurs in
it.
The existing code
The program works, mostly. There are some bugs.
The code is not well structured.
There are no tests.
It can be compiled as a .NET Core or a .NET Framework program.
Your job
Rewrite this program to fulfill the specification correctly.
Make the code beautiful.
Think about everything that could go wrong, and handle that with good error messages.
Write tests that you think are needed.
If the specification isn&#39;t clear enough about what to do in situations, make an assumption and
document it.
Technology
You may use .NET Framework or .NET Core, C# or F#, and all libraries and tools you need. As long as
you send us all files and instructions needed to run the program.
